# Preliminary Procedures

## Barcodes
In order to migrate content off of removable media, several preliminary steps must take place, which include creating an accession record in ArchivesSpace, applying a barcode to the media's housing, and photographing the media.

> Material that is clearly identified as duplicate or out of scope (i.e., multiple copies of a commencement address or a motion picture from a major studio)should be immediately separated from the collection. **Be sure to include the estimated extent (in KB, MB or GB) of the content on the removable media you separate without transferring on the Separation Record.**
